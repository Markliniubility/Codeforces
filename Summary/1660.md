# Codeforces Round 780 Div3 Summary

## Problem A
It can be proven by induction that if a > 0, any number from 1 to a + 2b 
can be expressed. However, one special cases, when a = 0, needs our attention.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    if (a > 0) {
        cout << (a + b * 2 + 1) << "\n";
    } else {
        cout << (1) << "\n";
    }
    
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int cases;
  cin >> cases;
  while (cases--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Problem B
Conclusion: As long as the difference between the largest and the second largest
is less than or equals to one, return yes.

Proof.
We want to show that if AND only if difference between the largest and the 
second largest is less than or equals to one, the result is YES.

The backward way is obvious. Suppose the diff is > 1,
obviously it doesn't work. By contradition, YES implies the diff <= 1.

The forward way is quite simple too. 
Base Case: only [1].
Induction Steps:
When the largest is eaten, it is still in this status.
By induction, the proof is completed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

#define ll long long

void solve() {
    int len;
    cin >> len;
    int lar = 0;
    int sec = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        int t;
        cin >> t;
        if (t >= lar) {
            sec = lar;
            lar = t;
        } else if (t > sec) {
            sec = t;
        }
    }
    bool invalid = lar - sec >= 2;

    cout << (!invalid ? "YES": "NO") << "\n";
}

int main() {
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  cin.tie(nullptr);

  int cases;
  cin >> cases;
  while (cases--) {
    solve();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

## Problem C

DP problem. Think about the state transitions. Will write more tomorrow.
