# Codeforces Contest 1525 Summary

## Problem A
It is a problem about GCD. Fairly Obvious.

## Problem B
Since the range cannot cover the whole array, the only meaning part is about
the first element and the last elements. I.E. How many steps we need to move
them back to their places. There are two and a half cases.

Case 0: The array is already in order. Nothing we need to do. Print 0.
Case 1: First OR last element is correct. One permutation is enough.
Case 2: Normal case. Move the first element/last element back to its position first.
Then. Similar to case 1.
Case 3 (Important): Case like \[3,2,1\]. We need to three moves.


## Problem C
This is a simulation problem in my opinion.
There are four ways of collusion
1. L-> <-R
2. <<-LL OR RR ->>
3. Only one possible collusion this case: <-L R->

PAIRTY is fairly important is this problem. We need to see that two robot may
collide ONLY IF they have the same parity!!!

The code is inspired by jiangly's solution. I didn't work it out myself lol.
